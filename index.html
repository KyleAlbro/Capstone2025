            Hi, my name's Kyle Albro, and this is What's For Dinner! <br><br>

            Back when I was at Montana Tech in Butte, I had to create a "useful mobile app" for Android—but I had no idea what to make. 
            I talked to friends and family, but nothing came to mind. Then, during a visit, my parents asked me the classic question: "What's for dinner?" That’s when it hit me.<br><br>

            Growing up, my family had a tradition—we’d go out to eat once a week, then grab groceries afterward. 
            But deciding where to go was always a struggle. So, I built an app that could randomly pick a restaurant nearby, making our weekly dinners easier.<br><br>

            I put a ton of work into it, but after the class ended, the project got put on the back burner. 
            Fast forward to another project assignment, where I had to create something original. This time, I decided to turn What's For Dinner into a website. 
            It brought its own set of challenges, and honestly, I thought it would be fun.<br><br>

            So, here it is! My contact info is at the bottom of each page if you want to reach out. Hope you enjoy!
